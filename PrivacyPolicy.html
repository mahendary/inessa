						<p>MIHY respects your privacy and recognizes the need to protect your personal information (any
							information by which you can be identified, such as name, address, financial information,
							and telephone number) you share with us. We would like to assure you that we follow
							appropriate standards when it comes to protecting your privacy on our web sites and
							applications.</p>

						<p>We track the Internet address of the domains from which people visit us and analyze this data
							for trends and statistics, but the individual user remains anonymous.</p>

						<p>Please note that our Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms and conditions available at
							https://inessa.co.in/TermsAndConditions.html </p>

						<p>A transaction on MIHY is to be conducted by persons above the age of 18 years only. If you
							are under 18 years of age, you are not allowed to make a transaction in MIHY. It is the duty
							of the legal guardians of all persons below 18 years of age to ensure that their wards do
							not make a transaction without their supervision on MIHY. It shall be automatically deemed
							that by allowing any person below the age of 18 years to transact on MIHY, their legal
							guardians have expressly consented to their use and we disclaim any liability arising from
							your failure to do so.</p>
						<p>We may collect your personal data when you:</p>




						<ul class="mt10 list-style-">

							<li>create an account with us or</li>
							<li>otherwise provide us with your personal data or</li>
							<li>use of any related services connected to MIHY or</li>
							<li>participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in
								activities we promote that might require information about you; or</li>
							<li>complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email)
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When you access MIHY, we will automatically collect your computer data, which may include</p>


						<ul class="mt10 list-style-">

							<li>browser type</li>
							<li>IP address</li>
							<li>language</li>
							<li>operating system</li>
							<li>cookies and the ID and location of your device</li>
							<li>the state or country from which you accessed MIHY</li>
							<li>the pages/videos you view</li>
							<li>length of time spent on pages/videos</li>
							<li>the services you use and the manner in which you use such services (e.g., the content
								you access, view, click on, search for, transact etc.)</li>
							<li>the date and time of your visit</li>
							<li>metadata, logs files, error logs</li>
							<li>other geographic and demographic information; and</li>
							<li>other hardware and software information.</li>
							<li>which pop up or push messages you might have seen and responded to</li>
							<li><b>Your Messages:</b> We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of providing
								our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your device and not typically
								stored on our servers. Once your messages are delivered, they are deleted from our
								servers.
								<br>
								<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; The following scenarios describe circumstances where we may store your
									messages in the course of delivering them:
									<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Undelivered Messages:</b>
									<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if the
									recipient is offline), we keep it in encrypted form on our servers for upto 30 days
									as we try to deliver it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; If a message is still undelivered after
									30 days, we delete it.
									<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Media Forwarding:</b>
									<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; When a user forwards media within a message, we store that media
									temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to aid in more efficient delivery of
									additional forwards.

									<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end
									encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third
									parties from reading them.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Transactions And Payments Data:</b> If you use our payments services, or use our
								Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional
								information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment
								account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the
								transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and
								transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or
								territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy
								policy.</li>
							<li><b>Customer Support And Other Communications:</b> When you contact us for customer
								support or otherwise communicate with us, you may provide us with information related to
								your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, any other information you
								deem helpful, and how to contact you (e.g., an email address). For example, you may send
								us an email with information relating to app performance or other issues.</li>
							<li><b>No Third-Party Banner Ads:</b> We still do not allow third-party banner ads on our
								Services. We have no intention to introduce them, but if we ever do, we will update this
								Privacy Policy.</li>
							<li><b>Business Interactions:</b> We enable you and third parties, like businesses, to
								communicate and interact with each other using our Services, such as Catalogs for
								businesses through which you can browse products and services and place orders.
								Businesses may send you transaction, appointment, and shipping notifications; product
								and service updates; and marketing. For example, you may receive flight status
								information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a
								notification when a delivery will be made. Messages you receive from a business could
								include an offer for something that might interest you. We do not want you to have a
								spammy experience; as with all of your messages, you can manage these communications,
								and we will honor the choices you make.</li>

						</ul>

						<p>This computer data is collected for analysis and evaluation in order to help us improve MIHY,
							the services we provide and to enhance your experience by providing you with better services
							and benefits that you shall be entitled to.</p>

						<p>To the extent that such computer data is maintained in a manner that identifies your name or
							contact information, it will be treated as personal data; otherwise, such computer data will
							be treated as non-personal data.</p>

						<p>The personal data we collect from you will be used, or shared with third parties (including
							related companies and third-party service providers), for some or all the following
							purposes:</p>

						<p>Below are the third parties whom we allow to set cookies or other technologies on your
							device.</p>
						<p><strong>Analytics Partners</strong>: In order to better understand how you use our platform,
							we work with various analytics partners. We allow analytics partners such as Google,
							Facebook analytics to use cookies, SDKs and other related technologies. For more information
							on how Google and Facebook use your data, please visit <a

						<h4 class="mb10">PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES</h4>
						<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the collection, processing, and use (including disclosure)
							of information by us through your interaction with the Site. Other websites that may be
							accessible through links from the Site may have their own privacy policies and personal
							information collection, processing, use, and disclosure practices. Our business partners may
							also have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the
							privacy policies provided by these other parties prior to providing them with information or
							taking advantage of a sponsored offer or promotion.</p>

						<h4 class="mb10">CONTACT UPLOAD</h4>
						<p>Contact upload is an optional feature that allows us to check which of your contacts in your
							device's address book are also Mihy users. It also means we can update your Mihy contact
							list when your contacts who aren't using Mihy yet sign up later. We care about your privacy
							and we don't share your contact list with anyone else.</p>

						<p>When you use contact upload and grant Mihy access to your device address book, Mihy will
							access and upload the phone numbers in your address book typically daily, but this depends
							on various factors including how often a user uses Mihy, including those of Mihy users and
							your other contacts. We don’t collect any of the other information that could appear in your
							device address book including names, email addresses, etc on our own.</p>

						<p>If any of your contacts aren’t yet using Mihy, we protect their privacy by managing the phone
							number in a way that is designed to prevent those contacts from being identified by Mihy. We
							do this by creating a cryptographic hash value of their phone number, and then delete the
							number. Each cryptographic hash value is stored on Mihy’s servers, linked to the Mihy users
							who uploaded the corresponding phone numbers before they were hashed so that we can more
							efficiently connect you with these contacts when they join Mihy.</p>

						<p>You can control the contact upload feature from your device-based settings. If you choose not
							to use Contact Upload you can still communicate with people who have Mihy but certain
							functionality will be limited.</p>
						<h4 class="mb10">COOKIES</h4>
						<p><strong>Consent:</strong> By using our website or mobile app (“Site”), using services
							provided through the Site, or receiving our emails, you consent to the use of cookies in
							accordance with this “Cookies Policy”.</p>

						<p><strong>Intent:</strong> This Privacy Policy sets out how we, and third parties we authorize,
							use cookies when you interact with our Site or the services offered via the Site. Our
							Privacy Policy explains what we do (and don't do) with the information, including any
							personal data we may collect about you. Please read them both.</p>

						<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> Cookies are unique identifiers, usually made up of small bits of
							text or code. Cookies are usually stored on your device or in your web browser and they send
							certain information back to the party who served the cookie. When we say cookies we are
							actually referring to a broader range of technologies than just cookies, including web
							beacons, clear gifs, pixels and other similar technologies. When we say first-party cookies
							we mean cookies that are served by MIHY. When we say third party cookies, we mean cookies
							that are served by non-MIHY parties.</p>

						<p><strong>Use of Cookies:</strong> Cookies are used in order to better understand how
							applications and websites work and to optimize online and mobile experiences. Cookies do
							this by allowing the party serving the cookie to analyze a website’s or mobile app’s
							performance, to identify certain users anonymously and remember their preferences, to better
							understand whether a computer or device (and probably its user) has visited a website
							previously and to serve personalized advertisements.</p>

						<p><strong>Types of Cookies:</strong> Our Site primarily uses the following four types of
							cookies:</p>

						<ul class="mt10 list-style-">

							<li><strong>Operations based Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;These cookies are essential for the
								operation of our Site. They make it possible for you to browse and use our Site. If you
								disable these cookies, the Site will not function correctly.</li>
							<li><strong>Performance based Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;These cookies gather information about
								how visitors use the Site and monitor Site performance. For example, performance cookies
								tell us which pages are popular, monitor traffic to our Site and compile anonymous
								analytic information. Performance cookies can also be used to identify and remedy
								operational problems with the Site.</li>
							<li><strong>Functionality based Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;These cookies are used to recognize
								and remember your preferences. For example, functionality cookies may use information,
								such as your location, to make sure that you arrive at a version of our Site that is
								specific to your city or region.</li>
							<li><strong>Advertising Preferences based Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;We offer you choices about
								receiving interest-based ads from us. For this, we allow third parties to deliver
								personalized advertising content on our Site and/ or on third party websites and
								applications. These third parties use cookies to understand your interest in the
								advertisements and content delivered to you, as well as to serve you with more relevant
								advertisements based on your activities on our Site. For example, third-party cookies
								could record information about whether you have clicked on certain content or
								advertisements on our Site or other websites or placed an item on our Site in your
								shopping cart.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>We do not have control over, or access to, third-party advertising cookies or the information
							they contain. Third parties manage any information that they collect via cookies they place
							in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

						<p>You may opt-out of third-party personalized advertising cookies. You will still see ads, but
							they will not be personalized.</p>

						<ul class="mt10 list-style-">

							<li><strong>Cookies and Browser settings:</strong>&nbsp;You may be able to avoid certain
								cookies by configuring your browser settings or opting out directly with party that
								operates and controls cookie. Please check your browser settings for more information
							</li>
							<li><strong>Cookies in E-mails:</strong>&nbsp;Our emails contain cookies that track whether
								you open our emails and whether you click any links within them. The cookies used in our
								emails to monitor these behaviors are unique to each email and are not stored on your
								computer or mobile device.</li>
						</ul>


						<h4 class="mb10">Third Party Plug-ins:</h4>
						<p>Our Platform also uses plug-ins of third parties in the form of a share button for Facebook,
							Twitter and WhatsApp. With the help of this share button, you can share our ad listings on
							the third parties’ platform provided that you are logged into these third parties. These
							third parties may be able to link your interaction with our platform to your account with
							them. Therefore, please read these third-party privacy policies before clicking on the share
							button.</p>

						<p>When you register an account or otherwise provide us with your personal data, we may also use
							the personal data to send to you marketing and/or promotional materials about us and our
							services from time to time. You can unsubscribe from receiving the marketing information at
							any time by using the unsubscribe function within the electronic marketing material.</p>

						<p>In order to provide our products and services to you or to otherwise fulfil contractual
							arrangements that we have with you, we may need to appoint other organizations to carry out
							some of the data processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example,
							payment processing organizations, delivery organizations, fraud prevention and screening and
							credit risk management companies, and mailing houses.</p>

						<p>We may share your data with advertising networks and/or social media platforms for the
							purposes of selecting and serving relevant adverts to you via those networks/platforms, and

							them so that they are able to verify the accuracy of the information you have shared with us
							while issuing your order.</p>

							read such third parties’ privacy statements.</p>

						<p><strong>We may share:</strong></p>
